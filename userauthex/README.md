```
0:00  Open website (no need to run localhost).

0:04  Enter email & password for a registered user, and click Sign in.
0:06  User is signed in, as shown by the text below.

0:19  Refresh the page while signed in.
0:22  Shows that the user is still signed in under the same user.
0:25  Clicks Sign out button. User is signed out.

0:26  Sign in using an unregistered email & password,
0:30  System gives a prompt that there is no user record for said credentials.

0:34  Using an unregistered email & password, when I click "Sign Up",
0:36  A user with said credentials is created in the Firebase Database.

0:40  Sign out & Sign in again to test that user is in fact in the database.
